Exactly! Name it **`Report.md`**. That way:

* **`README.md`** stays as the main project overview.
* **`Report.md`** can be your detailed business-style report with all charts, insights, and actionable recommendations.

You can even link it from your README like:

```markdown

```

This keeps the repo clean and professional, while giving managers or recruiters an easy path to dive into your results.

If you want, I can **draft a ready-to-use template for `Report.md`** similar to the README style but more business-focused.
